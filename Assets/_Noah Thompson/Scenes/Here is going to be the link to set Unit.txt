Here is going to be the link to set Unity up for online multiplayer(How to: Unity Online Multiplayer). The script will be pushed to the repo for NetworkButtons.cs 


 Notes on it @6:26 for the time. 
Change the PlayerController from being MonoBehavior to NetworkBehavior
Add a function called public override void OnNetworkSpawn(){
} and add if(!IsOwner) Destroy(this);
Add a new script called PlayerNetwork
Add private readonly NetworkVariable<Vector3> _netPos = new NetworkVariable<Vector3>(writePerm: NetworkVariableWritePermission.Owner);

Private readonly NetworkVariable<Quaternion> _netRot = new NetworkVariable<Vector3>(writePerm: NetworkVariableWritePermission.Owner);

Change mono to networkbehavior

If (IsOwner) {
	_netPos.Value = transform.position
	_netRot.Value = transform.rotation
}
Else {
	Transform.position = _netPos.Value
	Transform.rotation = _netRot.Value
